<h1>about me</h1>
Gila Almagor Agmon (Hebrew: גילה אלמגור אגמון; born Gila Alexandrowitz; July 22, 1939)<br/>
 is an Israeli actress, film star, and author.<br/>
 In Israel, she is known as "queen of the Israeli cinema and theatre".<br/>
Gila Alexandrowitz (Almagor) was born in Petah Tikva to Jewish emigrant parents from Europe.<br/>
 Her German-Jewish father Max Alexandrowitz was killed by an Arab sniper while working as a policeman<br/>
in Haifafour months before she was born. Her mother Chaya was from a Polish Orthodox Jewish family.<br/>
 Almagor grew up caring for her mother, who was slowly losing her sanity after realising that all <br/>
her family in Europe had been murdered in the Holocaust.<br/>
 When her mother was institutionalized in 1954, Almagor was sent to Hadassim youth village.<br/>
Two years later, she moved to Tel Aviv, rented a room near Habima Theatre, and applied to acting school.<br/>
 Although she was underage, she was accepted.<br/>
At the age of 17, Almagor debuted in Habima's production of The Skin of Our Teeth.<br/>
 Her autobiographical books Summer of Aviya and Under the Domim Tree <br/>
were both made into films, with Almagor playing her own mother. <br/>
She was married to Yaakov Agmon, former director of the Habima Theatre, until his death in 2020.They have two children.<br/>
Almagor has played leading roles in many plays, among them Anne Frank, Jeanne d'Arc, The Crucible, Three Sisters,<br/> 
The Bride and the Butterfly Hunt, They Were All My Children, and Medea.<br/>
She has appeared in over 50 films, including Siege, Queen of the Road, The House on Chelouche Street,<br/>
 Hide and Seek, El Dorado, Life According to Agfa and The Summer of Aviya.<br/>
Almagor starred as the mother of Avner, the main character in the 2005 film Munich.<br/>
 She also appears in The Debt, about a former Mossad agent who comes back to kill an escaped Nazi doctor.<br/>
In 2008, she played the role of Lolah Baum in the 100-episode serial Dani Hollywood, broadcast on the Yes satellite network.<br/>
 In 2005, Almagor played a therapist in the award-winning Israeli television series BeTipul.

<h2>Q1</h2>
First diffrent - web 1.0: read-only, web 2.0: read-write, web 3.0: semantic web.<br/>
                 In web 1.0 the users can not change contect on the site, users can not write comments or stuff like this.<br/>
                 In web 2.0 the users can add  comment and another stuff.<br/>
                 In wev 3.0 the users get adjusted content defend on some features like location, interests and more.<br/>
<br/>
Second diffrent - web 1.0: company focus, web 2.0: community focus, web 3.0: individual focus.<br/>
                  In web 1.0 most of the uses for the internet was for companies that want to provide serveses or for advertising.<br/>
                  In web 2.0 start to apper webs for community reasons and needs, becouse now every person can add contect to the web site.<br/>
                  In web 3.0 the the browser can save a lot of data on evrey user, so we can provide customized advertising.<br/>
<br/>          
Third diffrent - web 1.0: static pages, web 2.0: dynamic contect, web 3.0: 3D graphics.<br/>
                 In web 1.0 the page stay same.<br/>
                 In web 2.0 there is Dynamic content that is responsive to user input.<br/>
                 In web 3.0 The three-dimensional design is being used widely in websites and services in Web 3.0.<br/>
                Museum guides, computer games, e-commerce, geospatial contexts, etc. are all examples that use 3D graphics.<br/>
<h2>Q2</h2>
For example if user want to add comment to some site:<br/>
In web 1.0 he can do it only with sending a form, he can not post his comment in the site.<br/>
In web 2.0 he can add comment to the site that everyone can see his comment and respond to it.<br/>
In web 3.0 the web can suggest the user comments that the user want to write in the site, becuse the browser know the user well.<br/>
